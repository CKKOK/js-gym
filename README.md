# js-gym
A collection of personal solutions to small JavaScript problems. Includes, yes, fizzbuzz.

## delay.js
For creating artificial delays in code. Uses async/await and a promise at the backend to simulate a synchronous sleep.

## benchmark.js
For benchmarking functions. Originally used to compare performance between recursive and iterative pseudo-pointer implementations of binary searches on a phonebook with 1000 entries. Spoiler: no noticeable difference in at this scale.
